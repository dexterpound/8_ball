<h1>Return Values and return Statements</h1>
When you call the len() function and pass it an argument such as 'Hello', the function call evaluates to the 
integer value 5, which is the length of the string you passed it. In general, the value that a function call 
evaluates to is called the return value of the function.

When creating a function using the def statement, you can specify what the return value should be with a return statement. 
A return statement consists of the following:

The return keyword
The value or expression that the function should return
When an expression is used with a return statement, the return value is what this expression evaluates to. For example, the 
following program defines a function that returns a different string depending on what number it is passed as an argument.
